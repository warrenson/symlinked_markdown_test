## Overview

### Getting Access
All PFR users are allowed and encouraged to use powerPlant for their computational science needs. To get started, simply submit a request to HelpDesk with the subject *"powerPlant access request"*, asking them to enable your account for powerPlant. Actually, just [click here](%%%%%%%), hit Send, and we'll do the rest :) [test](%20a)

If you also require access to the Development environment, do specify so on your request (or submit a new one if you already have access).

Once your account is enabled, you will be able to use the same username and password you already use on your desktop. Please note that since powerPlant is based on Linux, the username should always be entered in **lower case**, and the `pfr\` prefix omitted.
